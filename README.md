# Cat Food Macro Calculator

Live Site: https://catcalc.netlify.com/

This application was built due to the lack of a clear resource to easily convert cat food products into traditional Carb, Protein, and Fat percentages.

To use the calculator, simply add the Crude Protein, Crude Fat, Moisture, and any Ash or Taurine measurements provided by the food's manufacturer.

From there, the totals will be converted into a Dry Matter Percentage and then converted into a Caloric Percentage based on kCal density.
